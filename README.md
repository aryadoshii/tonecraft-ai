# ToneCraft AI ✍️

**Your words, elevated.**
Paste any text, pick a tone — a 6-node AI agent pipeline rewrites it, checks quality, self-corrects, and explains every change.

## What it does

ToneCraft AI is a fully agentic text rewriting assistant. It doesn't just call an LLM once — it runs a **6-node LangGraph pipeline** that analyzes your text, recommends the best tones, rewrites with full context awareness, scores the quality, self-corrects if needed, and produces a detailed explanation of every change made.

Every rewrite is a multi-agent decision, not a single prompt.

---

## ✨ Features

### Core
- **✍️ 6 Tone Profiles** — Executive · Casual · Persuasive · Academic · Marketing · Diplomatic — each with a purpose-built instruction prompt.
- **📊 Side-by-Side Comparison** — original vs rewritten with word count delta and readability change.
- **📖 Explanation of Changes** — the agent explains exactly what was changed and why.
- **📚 Full Session History** — every rewrite is persisted to SQLite and reloadable from the sidebar with one click.
- **💬 Multi-Turn Chat Refinement** — after any rewrite, chat with the AI to further refine: "make it shorter", "add urgency", "change the opening".
- **🌧️ Stormy Morning Theme** — sky blue, lavender, and mint — dark and clean.

### Agentic
- **🔍 Intent Analyzer** — detects the content type (email, article, tweet, report…) and current tone of your input.
- **💡 Tone Recommender** — suggests the top 2 target tones based on what you wrote and what you're trying to achieve.
- **⚡ Live Token Streaming** — the rewrite streams token-by-token so you see it being written in real time.
- **🏆 LLM Quality Checker** — a dedicated agent scores the rewrite (0–100%) for meaning preservation and tone accuracy.
- **🔄 Auto-Refinement** — if quality score < 75%, the pipeline automatically re-rewrites with specific issue guidance, up to 3 attempts.
- **📈 Agent Pipeline Tracker** — a live visual shows all 6 agents: pending → active → done → skipped, updating in real time.
- **📋 Quality Report** — expandable breakdown showing per-round scores, progress bars, and flagged issues.

### 🏠 Home — Text Input + Tone Selector
<img src="frontend/assets/1-home.png" alt="ToneCraft AI Home" width="1000"/>

*Paste any text, pick a tone from the selector, and hit Rewrite. The agent pipeline fires immediately.*

---

### 🤖 Live Agent Pipeline Tracker
<img src="frontend/assets/2-pipeline.png" alt="Agent Pipeline" width="1000"/>

*All 6 agents are visualized in real time — each node lights up as it runs, greys out when done, and skipped nodes (like Refine when quality passes) are marked clearly.*

---

### ⚡ Live Token Streaming
<img src="frontend/assets/3-streaming.png" alt="Live Streaming" width="1000"/>

*The rewrite streams live token-by-token. Watch the text be written in real time inside the status panel.*

---

### 📊 Results — Side-by-Side Comparison
<img src="frontend/assets/4-results.png" alt="Results Panel" width="1000"/>

*Original and rewritten text side by side. Metadata badges show detected content type, input tone, quality score, and whether auto-refinement was triggered.*

---

### 📈 Quality Report
<img src="frontend/assets/5-quality.png" alt="Quality Report" width="1000"/>

*Expandable quality breakdown showing per-round scores, progress bars, and specific issues the quality agent flagged for each refinement attempt.*

---

### 💬 Multi-Turn Chat Refinement
<img src="frontend/assets/6-chat.png" alt="Chat Refinement" width="1000"/>

*After the initial rewrite, continue refining via chat. "Make it shorter", "add a stronger call to action", "soften the opening" — the agent updates the rewrite and explains every change.*

---

### 📚 Session History Sidebar
<img src="frontend/assets/7-history.png" alt="Session History" width="500"/>

*All rewrites and their chat threads are persisted in a local SQLite database. Load any past session instantly — including the full chat history.*

## 🤖 How the Agent Pipeline Works

Every rewrite runs a **6-node LangGraph graph**. The pipeline is split into three phases for live streaming:

```
Input Text + Target Tone
        ↓
[Phase 1 — Analysis Graph]
  analyze_intent   →  detects content type + current tone
  recommend_tones  →  suggests top 2 target tones with reasons
        ↓
[Phase 2 — Live Streaming Rewrite]
  stream_rewrite_tokens  →  rewrites token-by-token, streamed live to UI
        ↓
[Phase 3 — Quality Loop]
  check_quality  →  LLM scores rewrite 0–1 (meaning + tone accuracy)
       ↓ (if score < 0.75 and attempts < 3)
  refine         →  re-rewrites with specific issue guidance
       ↓ (loop back to check_quality)
  explain / finalize  →  promotes draft to final, locks result
        ↓
[Chat Graph — on demand]
  chat  →  applies follow-up refinement instructions from user
```

After the pipeline completes, the result, quality scores, and chat messages are all persisted to SQLite.

## 🤖 Agent Node Reference

| Agent | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Analyze Intent** | Classifies content type (email, article, tweet, report…) and detects the current tone of the input. |
| **Recommend Tones** | Suggests the top 2 target tones with reasons, shown as clickable chips before you choose. |
| **Rewrite** | Core rewrite using the tone instruction + content type context. Streams live to the UI. |
| **Check Quality** | Dedicated LLM call scoring 0–1: meaning preserved, tone achieved, no hallucinations. Lists specific issues. |
| **Refine** | Re-rewrites with the quality issues passed as explicit correction guidance. Loops back to Check Quality. |
| **Finalize** | Promotes the draft to final output. Runs only when quality passes or attempts are exhausted. |

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Paste** → Drop any email, post, report, or message into the text box.
2. **Pick a tone** → Choose from 6 profiles, or accept one of the AI's recommendations.
3. **Rewrite** → Watch the agent pipeline fire: analysis, streaming rewrite, quality check, and auto-refinement if needed.
4. **Review** → See the side-by-side comparison, quality score, metadata badges, and full explanation.
5. **Refine** → Chat to apply follow-up tweaks: shorten, harden, soften, redirect — as many turns as you need.
6. **Resume** → Every session is saved. Reload any past rewrite and continue the chat from exactly where you left off.

---

## 💡 What Makes This Different

Most rewriting tools are a single prompt wrapper. ToneCraft AI is an autonomous pipeline:

**1. The model checks its own work.** A separate quality agent scores every rewrite. If it doesn't pass, the pipeline automatically retries with targeted fix instructions — not the same prompt again, but a refined prompt built from the specific issues the checker found.

**2. You see the agents working.** The pipeline tracker shows every node in real time. You know exactly which agent is running, which passed, which was skipped, and why. There's no black box.

**3. The rewrite is a conversation.** After the initial pipeline, you can keep refining via multi-turn chat. The chat agent has the full original text, the current rewrite, and the complete message history — so every follow-up is contextually grounded, not a fresh start.

**Where to look for what:**
- Edit tone profiles or agent prompts → `config/settings.py`
- Add a new agent node → `agents/nodes.py` + `agents/graph.py`
- Change the pipeline UI → `frontend/components.py` + `frontend/styles.py`
- Database schema → `database/db.py`
